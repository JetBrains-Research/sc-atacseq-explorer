# sc-atacseq-explorer
Single cell ATAC-Seq processing pipeline inspired by [10x Genomics Single Cell ATAC](https://www.10xgenomics.com/solutions/single-cell-atac/)
* Cell Calling 
* Peak-Barcode Matrix
* Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering and t-SNE Projection
* Identification of highly variable features (feature selection)
* Hierarchical clustering
* PCA and SVD
* Clustering
* Heatmap on clusters built upon PCA
* t-SNE
* Differential peaks (markers)
* Heatmap on top markers
* BED files for clusters to visualize in [JBR Genome Browser](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/biolabs/tools/jbr-genome-browser) by JetBrains Research
* Differential clusters to BED for downstream analysis
* Closes genes annotating
* Data preparation for [single cell explorer](https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/shiny/single_cell_explorer) by Artyomov Lab
* Associated genes analysis
